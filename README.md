Data Cleaning & Extraction (2011–2021):

Import the dataset and filter data for the years 2011 to 2021.

Handle missing or inconsistent entries (e.g., impute or drop null values).

Ensure population figures are numeric and in proper format.

Line Graph for Yearly Trends:

Use libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to plot a line chart.

X-axis: Years (2011–2021)

Y-axis: Total Population

This visualizes the overall trend and allows identification of patterns like consistent growth, plateaus, or dips.
