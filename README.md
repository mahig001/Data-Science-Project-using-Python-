Data Cleaning & Extraction (2011–2021):
Import Dataset: Load the population data for the relevant years (2011–2021).

Filter Data: Select records only from 2011 to 2021.
1. Handle Missing Data:
Fill in missing or inconsistent population values using methods like mean imputation.

2. Ensure Data Quality:
Convert population figures to numeric format and clean up any invalid or non-numeric entries.

3. Plot Line Graph (2011–2021):
Use the years on the X-axis and total population on the Y-axis to visualize trends with tools like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

4. Analyze Trends:
Look for periods of growth, stagnation, or dips. Unusual changes may indicate external events or data issues worth investigating
